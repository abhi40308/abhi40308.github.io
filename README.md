# How to work with this repo
Fork this repository. Add the pages which you are assigned in your forked repo. And finally you can merge the forked repo with the original repo. 

But you have to be careful with it as you can directly commit changes to the original repo because you are collaborators. So any changes you make will directly take place to the original repo when you will merge. 

Please read and understand the git workflow beforehand. Acquire some basic knowledge of working with git before commiting anything to the original branch.
